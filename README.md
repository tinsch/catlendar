# catlendar

Catlendar is a small ruby script to generate PDF lists. Although they look like calendars, they are in fact lists to make sure someone has not already fed the cat (twice) today, because the cat asks for food anyway.

Catlendar asks you for the number of days you want to print and the number of columns. It uses the [Prawn Library]("https://github.com/prawnpdf/prawn") to generate the PDF.
